    <h2>European Elites</h2>
    <p>The landscape of European football is an ever-shifting being that is constantly in a form of metamorphosis, and
        the balance of power is one of the attributes that sees perhaps the most significant twists.

        Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, once said that “There is nothing permanent except change” and UEFA co-efficient
        was probably the basis for the historian’s claims, despite being born circa 535 B.C.

        In any case, the biggest teams of tomorrow may not necessarily be the same as today. Here, we’ll look at the
        parties that carry the biggest weight on the European stage as things stand.

        The inclusion of any club will take a variety of attributes into account including recent participation in
        European tournaments, league performances and even notable individual fixtures or encounters.

        History only counts for so much on this list and winning the Champions League several seasons ago will only do
        so much good if that team has greatly slumped in stature since then.</p>
